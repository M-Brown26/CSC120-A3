This assignment was a better confidence booster than the other one. In this one I actually got a part of the code to run correctly, which is progress! The easiest part of this assignment was the printing statements. That is also the first thing I realized was so much different. The for loop is what almost killed me. I knew what needed to happen, but using java to make a for loop is super complicated. Especially since I was using user input in the argument.  That's another thing that was hard: figuring out the syntax for userInput. However, the Guessing Game code we did in class helped a bit with that. Asher had to help me figure out how to set up the argument for the for loop, because no matter how I did it there were errors. I didn't have any classmates to connect with on this assignment. The one classmate I do know didn't get it either. The final thing I need to work on is the javadoc tags. I still don't get how to do those.
Overall I would say Java is a really complicated but interesting language to use. It's really fun to type out and see work, but way harder to plan out and understand. My advice this time would be to take baby steps. My plan for the whole assignment was 1) get the back and fourth working for the number of rounds 2.) randomize responses and then 3.) the mirroring.

TA/Office Hours: Attended Tueday @ 4:30 and Wednesday @ 7-9
- I'm becoming a regular with Asher. They are a big help and can explain things really well.
